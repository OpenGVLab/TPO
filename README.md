## üí° Introduction
Task Preference Optimization (TPO) is a new method designed to enhance the performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in handling visual tasks. Current MLLMs face challenges in precisely understanding visuals despite their capabilities in various vision applications. TPO addresses this by integrating differentiable task preferences from fine-grained visual tasks, introducing learnable task tokens to bridge the gap between task-specific heads and the MLLM. This results in improved multimodal capabilities and task-specific performance, with significant improvements demonstrated across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

- Enhanced Multimodal Performance: Achieves an average **14.6%** improvement in multimodal performance compared to baseline models on various image and video tasks, and demonstrates scalability across different MLLM architectures such as [VideoChat](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/TPO?tab=readme-ov-file#-model-zoo) and LLaVA.
- Robust Zero-Shot Capabilities: Performs comparably to state-of-the-art supervised models in zero-shot scenarios across various vision tasks.
- Synergistic Training: Multi-task co-training within TPO leads to mutual benefits, enhancing individual task performance beyond single-task training.

    <p>Figure 2: Overall Pipeline of TPO. The architecture of Task Preference Optimization (TPO) consists of four main components: (1) a vision encoder, (2) a connector, (3) a large language model, and (4) a series of visual task heads. Differently colored flame symbols indicate which components are unfrozen at various stages of the training process.</p>
